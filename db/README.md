# Database Directory

## Overview

This directory contains the SQL database used by the Langchain index's record manager. The database is responsible for managing and storing metadata, document records, and other relevant information necessary for the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.

## Database File

- **record_manager_cache.sql**: The SQLite database file where all the indexed records are stored. This file is automatically generated and updated by the Langchain indexing process.

## Usage

The database is used internally by the RAG system to:
- Store document metadata and chunk information.
- Manage the indexing of documents.
- Support efficient retrieval of documents during the question-answering process.

## Important Notes

- **Do Not Delete**: The `record_manager_cache.sql` file is critical for the operation of the RAG system. Deleting this file will result in the loss of all indexed data and require a complete re-indexing of the documents.
- **Backup**: It's recommended to periodically back up this database file, especially if the index contains valuable or large amounts of data.
- **Storage Location**: By default, the database is stored in this `db` directory, but the location can be configured in the project settings.

## How to Rebuild the Index

If the database is deleted or corrupted, the index can be rebuilt by re-running the indexing process in the RAG system. This will regenerate the `record_manager_cache.sql` file with the current documents in the system.

## Additional Information

For more details on how the indexing process works and how the database is utilized, refer to the main project [README.md](../README.md).

**Note:** The database used in this project is SQLite, a lightweight, disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process. It’s a good fit for smaller projects and quick deployments.
